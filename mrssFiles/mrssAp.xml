                        <title>Near miss: pedestrian narrowly escapes truck collision in Krasnoyarsk, Russia</title>
                        <description>In a heart-stopping incident near Krasnoyarsk, Russia, on September 11, 2023, a pedestrian narrowly escaped a catastrophic collision with a multi-ton truck. The harrowing moment was captured on video as the truck careened off the road, hurtling towards the pedestrian at high speed. Miraculously, the pedestrian managed to evade the oncoming disaster just in the nick of time. The truck, however, plowed through a fence and tumbled into a ditch, severing a power line and overturning in the process. The video footage shows the truck's cab detaching from the rest of the vehicle as it veered off the road. The fate of the truck's driver remains uncertain. </description>

                        <description>On September 12, 2023, a Ural Airlines plane en route from Sochi to Omsk made an emergency landing in the Novosibirsk region in Russia, specifically in the Ubinsk area. The aircraft, carrying 167 passengers, touched down on a grass field. The cause of the incident was a lack of fuel, which occurred as a result of a change in landing airport due to a failure of the hydraulic system on the plane. Fortunately, there were no casualties, and all passengers were safely evacuated. They have since been transported to Omsk via train.</description>

                        <description>In a heartwarming incident in Dagestan, Russia, on September 10, 2023, an employee of the Levashinsky district electrical networks performed a daring rescue. A cat had found itself stranded atop a power line support pole, unable or unwilling to make its way down. Devoid of the feline's natural climbing abilities, the man utilized a specialized tool known as fitter's claws to carefully retrieve the distressed cat. He then called for assistance from his colleagues, who arrived with a piece of cloth to hold the cat as it made its way down. With a gentle release from the pole, the cat descended to safety, unharmed.</description>

                        <description>On the morning of September 9, 2023, in the village of Staraya Stanitsa near Kamensk in Russia's Rostov region, an unusual incident unfolded that left locals both bewildered and amused. A bold dog, resembling a shepherd, commandeered a passenger bus near the Charm store, prompting the driver and all passengers to evacuate. Although the canine intruder didn't exhibit direct aggression, it firmly maintained control over the vehicle, resisting attempts to coax it out with sausages. Local rescuer Evgeny Filippenkov came to the rescue, donning protective gear, armed with a stick and rope, and successfully led the determined dog out of the bus. Presently, the dog awaits its owner's return at a nearby watermelon point of sale, serving as a peculiar reminder of a remarkable day in Staraya Stanitsa.</description>

                        <title>Vandal shatters princess Turandot sculpture in Arbat, Moscow</title>
                        <description>In a shocking act of vandalism, an unknown man wreaked havoc on the historic Princess Turandot sculpture, located in front of the Vakhtangov Theater in the heart of Moscow's Arbat district in Russia. The incident, which took place on September 9, 2023, was captured on video and has left both art enthusiasts and theatergoers stunned. The iconic fountain-monument, erected in 1997 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first production of the eponymous play, has deep roots in the theater's rich history, dating back to the premiere of "The Miracle of St. Anthony" in 1921. As the man climbed atop the statue, his reckless actions led to the sculpture's dramatic shattering, sending him tumbling down in a startling descent, marking a tragic chapter in the theater's legacy. The man was taken to Botkin Hospital with fractures and a head injury.</description>
