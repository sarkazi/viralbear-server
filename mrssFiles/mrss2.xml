             <media:description>As of July 15, 2023, Akita Prefecture, Japan, is facing ongoing disruptions due to severe flooding caused by heavy downpours. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has issued orange-level heavy rain and landslide warnings, along with yellow flood advisories across the region. The storms, accompanied by strong winds, lightning, hail, and potential tornadoes, have led to dangerous river levels and widespread transportation disruptions. Several cities and towns, including Akita, Daisen, Noshiro, Oga, Fujisato, Gojome, and Hachirogata, are under evacuation orders. The Babame and Uchikawa rivers have overflowed, causing significant flooding and damage to properties in affected areas. Tragically, one person has already lost their life due to the heavy rain. The Akita Shinkansen has been suspended between Morioka and Akita stations, further exacerbating the situation. @be5b48tgmailcom captured a video showing flooding in Akita station east exit rotary.</media:description>
