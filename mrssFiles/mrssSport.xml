                  <media:description>On February 24, 2023, Cam FitzPatrick, a snowboarder from the United States, had an unforgettable experience in Alaska. Cam was snowboarding down the mountain at great speed, and he described it as "probably the fastest I’ve ever gone on a snowboard." He added, "HOLY MOLY AK is humbling!"

Cam FitzPatrick had been snowboarding for years, but he had never experienced anything quite like Alaska. 

However, as Cam was snowboarding down the mountain, he encountered a trough. As he accelerated even faster, the trough began to come off, and Cam fell. It was a terrifying experience, but thankfully, he managed to get up quickly and was not injured.

                  <media:title>Bird on the field at Dodger Stadium steals show during Game 2 between Padres and Dodgers!</media:title>
                  <media:description>12 October 2022, Los Angeles, USA

While the Dodgers and Padres were locked in a tight battle during Game 2 of the National League Division Series, they had a very special fan join the proceedings.

As Los Angeles tried to rally from a 5-3 deficit in the bottom of the eighth inning with Gavin Lux at the plate, a duck appeared just outside the infield. With the wild animal likely confused and in the middle of the action, play was halted for a bit as stadium officials tried to figure out what to do.

Eventually, the duck was safely corralled by workers at the stadium.
