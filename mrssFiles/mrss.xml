                  <media:title>First-time rider's mishap: girl's scooter adventure ends with a bump!</media:title>
                  <media:description>In a candid video captured by @wkmzxuk_ on July 15, 2023, in the City of Soligorsk, Minsk region, Belarus, a young girl's first-time experience with an electronic scooter took an unexpected turn. With enthusiasm and excitement, she hopped onto the scooter but found herself struggling to control its speed. Unaware of the gears and unfamiliar with braking, she careened toward a stationary sign near a building, unable to halt her momentum. The result was a comical yet cautionary collision, reminding viewers of the importance of learning the basics before embarking on new adventures. While the girl's misadventure might have left her a little shaken, it undoubtedly served as a valuable lesson for both her and others who dare to ride the scooters for the first time.</media:description>

                  <media:description>In a heart-stopping incident captured on video on June 28th, 2023, a mother from Nam Dinh province, Vietnam, had a close call as her son narrowly escaped being struck by a falling door. The mother, identified as @kem.store0 on social media, was leaving on her motorbike parked inside the store. As she opened the door to exit, she left her son in charge of closing the store's doors. Unfortunately, one of the doors unexpectedly came off its hinges, causing it to crash down dangerously close to the young boy as he struggled to maintain his balance. Though he cried in fright, thankfully, he emerged from the incident unharmed. Unaware of the incident, the mother had already left.</media:description>
