According to the videographer, the man is 51-year-old Udin Mega, who is known locally for his uncanny ability to walk on water.

He easily walked over to the boat to join the passengers.</media:description>

                          <media:description>In a clever and effective method for tackling a moth problem in Karawang, Indonesia, a video captured by @ruharu_01 on October 16, 2023, showcases a man's ingenious approach. With his smartphone's torch function, the man approached an outdoor light that had been attracting moths, then switched off the light, leaving the moths only with the illumination from his mobile device. Slowly backing away towards a nearby streetlight, the moths followed the smartphone light until they encountered the brighter streetlight, leading them to divert their flight path. This simple yet innovative solution successfully eliminated the moth issue.</media:description>

                          <media:description>Nestled in the heart of Lebanon lies Tannourine, a place of remarkable natural beauty. One of its most captivating attractions is the Baloue Balaa or Baatara Gorge Waterfall, where a stunning waterfall flows through a vast sinkhole.

This mesmerizing display of nature's grandeur leaves visitors awestruck, as the cascading waters gracefully make their way through the rocky landscape into the depths of the earth.

                          <media:description>On April 25, 2023, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a captivating incident was caught on video by @abbytamargo_. At a yearly university event featuring structures designed by architecture students, the primary criterion for passing was that these models must support over 20 kilograms. During a demonstration, a student was asked to stand on one of the models, constructed from cardboard and ice cream sticks, which nearly resulted in a precarious tumble. However, quick action from two individuals prevented her from taking a fall, showcasing the impressive structural integrity of the student's creation.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On July 30, 2023, a mesmerizing sight graced the city of Rakov, Belarus, as @lucyfer_da captured a stunning video of a rainbow during her return journey. After a trip to Nalibokskaya Pushcha, she noticed a remarkably bright and clear rainbow hovering over a distant lake. Throughout the drive, the rainbow remained elusive, often obscured by trees and buildings. However, as they ventured onto the track and turned a corner, the rainbow revealed its full splendor, stretching wider than the entire roadway. Onlookers were left in awe, with people pulling over to capture the spectacle with their cameras. Curiously, there was no rain preceding or following the rainbow, but within its vivid hues, a fine drizzle could be seen, akin to droplets from a spray bottle. As if one rainbow wasn't enough, a larger, fainter one appeared above the brilliant arc, adding to the enchantment of the moment. Nature's breathtaking display left a lasting impression on all who bore witness to this extraordinary occurrence.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Musical ingenuity: turning a pen and paper box into a Guzheng</media:title>
                          <media:description>In Gansu Province of Northwest China, a talented musician known as @whatisitcalled stumbled upon a remarkable discovery on 1st May, 2023. Armed with nothing but a pen, several rubber bands, and a discarded paper box, she unlocked the potential to create a unique musical instrument – the guzheng.

Inspired by the rich tradition of Chinese music, @whatisitcalled's inventive spirit led her to experiment with unconventional materials. By ingeniously tying a pen to the paper box using rubber bands, she managed to fashion a makeshift guzheng. Little did she know that her creation would soon produce enchanting melodies.

With her newly crafted instrument in hand, she embarked on a journey of exploration and artistic expression. Testing the limits of her unconventional guzheng, she found herself playing a classical martial arts song. As her nimble fingers plucked the rubber band strings, the melodies emanating from the instrument transcended its humble origins.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Traditional Chinese cuisine: cooking and enjoying pig's brain in an iron cup</media:title>
                          <media:description>China is famous for its rich and diverse cuisine, with a long history that dates back thousands of years. The country's cuisine varies widely from region to region, and each area has its own unique dishes and cooking techniques. One such dish is the pig's brain, which is considered a delicacy in some parts of China.

@HappyBarbecueHouseChief, a food video blogger based in Sichuan Province, China, recently shared a video on his social media account on 1st of May, 2023, showcasing the traditional method of cooking pig's brain in an iron cup. In the video, he can be seen preparing and cooking the dish, as well as enjoying it at the end.

The preparation process for pig's brain involves several steps. First, the pig's brain is thoroughly cleaned and washed to remove any impurities. Then it is marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, ginger, garlic, and other spices.

Once the brain is marinated, it is then cooked in an iron cup using a traditional method. The iron cup is heated on a stove, and the marinated pig's brain is added to the cup along with some vegetables and broth. The ingredients are then simmered for several minutes until the pig's brain is fully cooked.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Florida residents amazed by SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket launch</media:title>
                          <media:description>On the evening of April 30, 2023, residents of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, were treated to an awe-inspiring sight: the launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. The rocket took off from Cape Canaveral, which is about 200 miles north of the city, but the smoke plume from the launch was visible in the sky for several minutes after the event. @DavidVergel97 captured a video showing the time lapse of the launch.

Many people in Sunny Isles Beach were confused when they first saw the smoke plume, as they had no idea what it was. But as news of the launch spread, excitement and wonder grew among the local residents. The sight of the rocket launching into the sky was truly breathtaking, and many people were left in awe at the sheer power and technology that went into making the launch a reality.

The Falcon Heavy rocket is one of SpaceX's most impressive achievements to date. It is capable of carrying heavy payloads into orbit, which makes it ideal for missions to the International Space Station, as well as for launching satellites into space. The rocket is also designed to be reusable, which makes it a more cost-effective option for space launches in the long run.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Finger fishing: a fun and easy trick to catch fish without bait!</media:title>
                          <media:description>Fishing is one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, with millions of people heading to lakes, rivers, and oceans to try their hand at catching a fish. But what if we told you that there is a way to fish without using bait? It may sound crazy, but it's actually possible, as demonstrated by @kristensbearden in a recent video clip he shared on social media on April 17th, 2023.

In the video, @kristensbearden can be seen standing at the edge of a pond with three boys. This happens in Texas, USA. He dips his finger in the water and waits patiently for a fish to bite. Within seconds, one of the boys tries the trick and successfully catches a fish with his finger. The rest of the boys cheer and laugh as he shows off his catch.

This fishing technique is called "finger fishing," and it is a fun and easy way to catch fish without using any bait. It may not be the most traditional way to fish, but it can be a great alternative for those who don't want to invest in expensive fishing gear or spend hours preparing bait.</media:description>

                          <media:description>In Yeysk, a city located in the Krasnodar Territory of Russia, a military parade of kindergarten students was recently held, much to the controversy of some citizens. The event, which was called "We are the great-grandchildren of the great winners," saw young children marching in formation while wearing costumes designed to represent different types of troops.

Mayor Roman Bublik expressed his pride in the event, stating that it was the first of its kind in the Yeysk region and that it would become an annual tradition. However, not everyone was as enthusiastic about the parade.

The children's parents watched the procession from the stands. Some citizens expressed their discomfort with the use of young children in a military-style event, particularly in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the increasing involvement of schoolchildren and even kindergarteners in patriotic actions.</media:description>

                          <media:title>A dazzling display: stunning northern lights illuminates Helena, Montana</media:title>
                          <media:description>Residents of Helena, Montana were treated to a breathtaking display of the Northern Lights on the evening of April 24th, 2023. Captured by @StaciaDahl, the footage shows a stunning aurora of green lights illuminating the night sky over the city.

The Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, are a natural phenomenon caused by particles from the sun colliding with the Earth's atmosphere. This collision creates a colorful light show that is most visible in regions close to the Earth's magnetic poles.

While the Northern Lights are typically associated with northern regions such as Alaska and Canada, they occasionally make an appearance in more southern areas such as Montana. The conditions for viewing the Northern Lights require a combination of clear skies, a lack of light pollution, and heightened solar activity. Credit to: @StaciaDahl</media:description>

                          <media:title>Riding the rails: miniature steam train delights in Leyland, Lancashire</media:title>
                          <media:description>In Leyland, Lancashire, a group of steam train enthusiasts gathered on March 5th, 2023 to ride a miniature train along miniature rails. The locomotive, a 5-inch gauge scale replica of a GWR Pannier Tank, was built by one of the club members, John, in his garage using his own engineering skills and designs created many years ago.

The event was captured on video by @fletch6619, a steam train enthusiast who is passionate about building awareness of the hobby among younger generations. 

The video shows a group of adults and children riding the miniature train, with smiles on their faces and excitement in their voices. As the train chugs along the miniature rails, it's easy to see why this hobby is so beloved by those who partake in it.

Steam train enthusiasts often cite the sense of nostalgia and connection to the past as reasons for their love of the hobby. Miniature live steam trains, in particular, offer a unique experience that allows enthusiasts to feel like they are in control of a real train, even though it is only a small replica.

John, the builder of the locomotive, is a prime example of the passion and dedication that many steam train enthusiasts have for their hobby. By using his engineering skills and his own designs, he was able to create a beautiful replica of the GWR Pannier Tank, which is a testament to the craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into miniature live steam trains.

                          <media:title>Static electricity woes: why candy wrappers refuse fall into a container</media:title>
                          <media:description>On April 2nd, 2023, a curious phenomenon occurred in Saskatoon, Canada. @wh0recarr0t, a local resident, was shelling chocolates for a batch of cookies when she noticed that the candy wrappers were falling all over the counter. Initially, she thought it was due to her bad aim but soon realized that static electricity was the culprit.

"I deliberately tried to clean them up into the container and they were jumping out right after I put them in so I knew it wasn't my bad aim after all," she explained.

Static electricity is a type of electrical charge that builds up on an object's surface due to the transfer of electrons. It occurs when two objects come into contact and then separate, causing the electrons to transfer from one object to the other. The result is a build-up of electric charge that can cause objects to stick together or repel each other.

In the case of candy wrappers, the static charge builds up on the surface of the wrapper as it rubs against other objects during manufacturing, handling, or storage. When the wrapper comes into contact with another object, such as a cookie or a hand, the static charge can cause it to stick to the object or jump away from it.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Thrill of the chill: ice swimming &amp; picnicking on frozen lake Baikal</media:title>
                          <media:description>Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world, located in Siberia, Russia. During the colder months, the lake's surface freezes over, creating a stunning landscape of ice formations. One of the most unique and fascinating formations is the "Sea of Ice Needles." These long, thin ice structures protrude upward like needles and are formed when waves break up the thin surface ice, and water splashes up and freezes into these unique shapes.

On March 31, 2023, a group of people in wetsuits took the plunge and went swimming in Lake Baikal's icy waters. In a video captured by @egor_lesnoy, the thrill of the chill can be felt as these brave swimmers navigate the icy waters and the Sea of Ice Needles.

But this wasn't just any swim - the group decided to take it a step further and have a picnic in the middle of the lake, using the ice instead of utensils. It's a unique experience that only a few have dared to try, but the breathtaking beauty of Lake Baikal's frozen landscape is worth it.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On March 27, 2023, residents of Moscow captured a giant black smoke ring on video after an incident in Strogino. The mysterious black ring appeared in the sky above Moscow and footage of the unusual phenomenon was published online by eyewitnesses.

According to officials, such occurrences are not rare: similar rings are formed from smoke that is suddenly released from pipes, such as from a boiler room. Without dispersing, the exhaust takes the form of a ring or loop and drifts through the sky. This was stated by the head of the meteorology and climate department of the Central Hydrometeorological Service, Nikolai Tereshonok, on television. The official assured that the ring does not pose a threat to the residents of the capital and should soon dissipate.</media:description>

                          <media:title>A Tuvan woman wins first place in a ram lifting contest with 60 squats on shoulders</media:title>
                          <media:description>A woman from Tuva, Russia has made headlines for her impressive feat of strength. Aiza Idam-Syuryun made 60 squats while carrying a 50-kilogram ram on her shoulders. 

Idam-Syuryun participated in the "Khoi Kodureri" competition, which translates to "lifting the ram," and won first place among the women. The men's competition was won by Namchyakay Buyan, who completed 171 squats with the same weight.

Idam-Syuryun explained that she doesn't engage in any sports and attributed her success to natural endurance. She didn't plan on participating in the competition and decided to give it a try on a whim.

"I just went to celebrate Shagaa near my house. I was passing by the competition area and saw a woman carrying a ram on her shoulders and squatting with it. It caught my interest... So, I decided to test my strength and give it a try. I didn't even think about winning, but I did!" said Idam-Syuryun.

As a prize, she was awarded the ram that she lifted during the competition. While some may view this type of competition as unusual, it is a traditional part of the Shagaa celebration in Tuva.</media:description>

                          <media:description>A video posted by Instagram user @aeseobi has been creating waves on social media, featuring two talented kids in Busan, Korea. In the video, a six-year-old child is seen riding a pole, while a nine-year-old child plays the recorder. The children's mother runs a pole dance academy and it seems the children inherited some of their mother's talent.

According to the video's description, the second child became interested in pole dancing after watching videos of her mother riding the pole. Although the child did not receive formal lessons, the mother taught the child some basic moves. The six-year-old child's pole riding skills are truly impressive for their young age, and the nine-year-old child's recorder playing skills are also noteworthy.</media:description>

                          <media:description>Anwyl Chang, an avid FPV drone enthusiast, recently attempted an impressive stunt in Winnipeg, Canada. With a small custom FPV drone, Chang attempted to complete as many full loops around himself as possible.

In a video posted on social media by @avasianfpv, Chang can be seen flying the drone in tight circles around himself, performing what are known as "dead loops." As the video progresses, Chang successfully completes multiple loops, each one more impressive than the last.

However, the stunt eventually takes a bit dangerous turn. Towards the end of the video, Chang loses control of the drone and it crashes into his head. Despite the accident, both Chang and the drone appear to be unharmed.</media:description>

                          <media:title>The Offbeat Sport of Riding Wakeboard After Bulls in Kerala's Malabar Region | FPV Drone</media:title>
                          <media:description>In Kerala's Malabar region, after the monsoon season, a unique and thrilling sport called Kalppoot takes place. The sport involves riding a wakeboard while being towed by a pair of bulls, and it is considered to be one of the most offbeat sports in India.

On 22 December 2022, a talented FPV drone pilot, @fpvwithshuraim, captured stunning footage of the sport from above using a custom FPV drone equipped with a GoPro camera. In the footage, we see a young man skillfully navigating the rough waters while being towed by two bulls.

The sport of Kalppoot has been a traditional activity in the Malabar region for many years. It is said to have originated as a way for farmers to train their bulls to be more obedient and agile in the fields. Over time, it evolved into a competitive sport that attracts participants and spectators from all over the region.

Executing a successful run in Kalppoot requires a great deal of skill, courage, and quick thinking. As the rider is towed behind the bulls, he must navigate the choppy waters of the river, dodge obstacles, and avoid being thrown off the board. Meanwhile, the bulls must be carefully guided by their handlers, who use whistles and verbal commands to keep them on track.

According to the FPV drone pilot who captured the footage, executing the shot was a challenging task. With less than 30 seconds between each round, he had to be quick on his feet and agile with his drone. Despite the difficulties, he was pleased with the outcome and managed to capture some stunning footage of the sport.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Stunning Aurora Display in Anchorage, Alaska</media:title>
                          <media:description>On the night of February 27th, 2023, the residents of Anchorage, Alaska were treated to a mesmerizing display of the Aurora Borealis. A video of the phenomenon was captured and credited to Brian Brettschneider, a well-known climatologist in the region.

The Aurora Borealis, also known as the Northern Lights, is a natural light display that occurs in high-latitude regions, such as Alaska. It is caused by particles from the sun colliding with the Earth's atmosphere and creating a stunning display of colorful lights in the sky.

The video captured by Brian Brettschneider shows the green and pink hues of the Aurora Borealis dancing across the sky. The colors are mesmerizing, and the movement of the lights is almost otherworldly.

The Northern Lights are a common occurrence in Alaska, but they are not always visible. To see them, the skies must be clear and free of light pollution, and there must be a high level of solar activity. Residents and tourists alike often travel to remote areas of the state to get the best view of this stunning natural phenomenon.

                          <media:title>A talented designer created a cozy pet carrier hoodie</media:title>
                          <media:description>Jill Leighton is a small Etsy shop owner from Franklin, Maine, USA. On January 21, 2023, she posted a video on social media showcasing her latest creation, a pet carrier hoodie. The carrier hoodie features a cozy and comfortable design, perfect for keeping pets warm during the chilly winter months and carrying them easily.

The cat in the video is Coba, a 3-year-old feline who made his way into Leighton's life a few winters ago. Coba appeared on the front step of their rural home, and Leighton and her family took it upon themselves to make sure he was healthy and to search for any possible owners. Unfortunately, no one came forward to claim Coba, and he was found to be in a poor state, full of worms, and unneutered. It is believed that he was born outside and never had a permanent home. 

She immediately took Coba to the vet and made him a part of their family. He has since been grateful for their love and care, and he is the inspiration behind the pet carrier hoodie design. On social media, her item has gotten a lot of attention, and many cat lovers and pet owners have said how much they like the creative design.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Nordic Skaters Discover Methane Bubbles in Skelleftea - Watch Them Burst and Burn</media:title>
                          <media:description>On 27 December 2022, a group of Nordic skaters stumbled upon a unique natural phenomenon in Skelleftea, Sweden. The group, led by @sven.burman, discovered methane bubbles underneath the ice while on their skating tour.

The bubbles, a result of decaying organic matter in the soil, were punctured and lit on fire by the skaters, creating a fascinating display of burning gas. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and its presence in the Arctic is particularly concerning as it has a much greater warming effect than carbon dioxide.

However, these methane releases are not uncommon in the Arctic and have been observed for centuries. They serve as a reminder of the unique and constantly changing environment in the far North. The experience was captured on video and shared on social media, providing a window into this captivating natural event.

Methane bubbles are a fascinating aspect of the Arctic's delicate ecosystem and the display of their release and combustion is a sight to behold. The group of skaters were lucky to witness this rare occurrence and share their experience with the world.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Krasnoyarsk pensioner makes extreme descents on the rocks Stolby Reserve</media:title>
                          <media:description>Andrey Andronovich Didukh, a pensioner from Divnogorsk, is one of the well-known personalities in the Stolby Reserve. On Stolby, Andronych, as everyone calls him, shows tourists a unique descent from the Perya cliff along a crevice, known as the “Skinder” course.

The height of the Perya rock, which consists of four peaks, is 42 m. 16 passages lead upstairs. (The rock is very difficult to climb, and it was on Feathers that another famous Krasnoyarsk stalker Volodya Teplykh crashed to death.)

Andrei Andronych is over 70 years old, but any young athlete will envy his physical form.

He earns a living from excursions, the sale of interesting natural finds and such performances as in the video: tourists often give him money for a show that tickles the nerves. Andrei descends from the cliff barefoot and without insurance.

                          <media:title>Realistic robot bird or ornithopter with morphing-coupled wingbeat pattern</media:title>
                          <media:description>6 August 2022, Hong Kong, China

Flying vertebrates exhibit sophisticated wingbeat kinematics. Their specialized forelimbs allow for the wing morphing motion to couple with the flapping motion during their level flight. Previous flyable bionic platforms have successfully applied bioinspired wing morphing but cannot yet be propelled by the morphing-coupled wingbeat pattern. Inspired by this, a team of Hong Kong scientists a bioinspired flapping-wing aerial vehicle entitled RoboFalcon, which is equipped with a novel mechanism to drive the bat-style morphing wings, performs a morphing-coupled wingbeat pattern, and overall manages an appealing flight. The novel mechanism of RoboFalcon allows coupling the morphing and flapping during level flight and decoupling these when maneuvering is required, producing a bilateral asymmetric downstroke affording high rolling agility. The bat-style morphing wing is designed with a tilted mounting angle around the radius at the wrist joint to mimic the wrist supination and pronation effect of flying vertebrates’ forelimbs. Wind tunnel tests indicate that the rolling moment of the asymmetric downstroke is correlated with the flapping frequency, and the wrist mounting angle can be used for tuning the angle of attack, lift-thrust configuration, and power consumption of the equilibrium flight state.
