The severity of the situation has forced authorities to close off some sections of the international park to tourists to ensure their safety.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On October 28, 2023, in Mendoza, Argentina, @sthefi.guajardo recorded a striking video depicting the sheer force of the infamous "zonda" wind. Characterized by its intensity, aridity, and scorching temperatures, the zonda wind is a meteorological phenomenon that materializes under specific climatic conditions in regions adjacent to the Andes Mountains. In the footage, a tree succumbs to the unrelenting gales, collapsing onto the road, vividly illustrating the destructive potential of this natural occurrence. The zonda wind, a regional name for the foehn wind, is known to wreak havoc, including fires and various other natural disasters, particularly on the eastern slopes of the Andes in Argentina.</media:description>

                          <media:description>In a dramatic video captured by @_tomlewis on October 26, 2023, in Dubai Marina, UAE, a construction worker faced a harrowing ordeal when a sudden storm with strong winds hit the area. The worker was perched on a suspended movable platform, several stories above the ground, working on a high-rise building. As the winds intensified, the platform swung precariously, causing a collision with the skyscraper. The impact shattered the glass exterior of the skyscraper, sending shards plummeting downward. The heart-stopping incident repeated itself as the storm raged on. The current status of the worker's safety remains unknown.</media:description>

                          <media:description>@StartBayInn, located in Torcross, Devon, UK, captured a reassuring video on October 18, 2023, following the passage of Storm Babet. As the second named storm of the season, Babet had caused concerns as it developed west of the Iberian Peninsula before heading north and impacting Britain. In the video, the waves, although still beating against the seafront, exhibited notably less intensity. The video, taken by one of the pub's owners, Gail, portrayed the relief of finding the pub dry inside and the road open after Gail's morning check following high tide. </media:description>

                          <media:description>On October 17, 2023, Storm Babet unleashed its fury on the coastal town of Mousehole in Cornwall, UK, with relentless 80mph gale force winds and torrential rain. As captured in a video by @JaneJohnsonBakr, the seafront bore the brunt of this powerful storm, as waves crashed against the shoreline. The Met Office issued an amber warning for the region, urging residents to take precautionary measures. With the area in the storm's grip, locals like @JaneJohnsonBakr were "battening down the hatches" to weather the wild conditions. </media:description>

                          <media:description>Typhoon Koinu, aptly named "puppy" in Japanese, made a powerful landfall on Taiwan's Hengchun peninsula on October 5, 2023, unleashing devastating winds with speeds reaching up to 252 kilometers per hour (156 mph). The storm's ferocity was captured in a video by @APetersen408 at Howard Beach Resort, showing trees swaying ominously in the fierce winds and rain. This category four typhoon left a trail of destruction in its wake as it brushed past Taiwan, but fortunately, it began to weaken after crossing into the island, sparing the region from even more catastrophic damage.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Tropical storm Ophelia approaches North Topsail beach near Wilmington!</media:title>
                          <media:description>As Tropical Storm Ophelia advances towards the Wilmington area, residents and authorities are mobilizing to mitigate potential damage. With winds nearing hurricane levels and rainfall intensifying, concerns about the storm's impact are growing.

Governor Roy Cooper wasted no time in signing an executive order declaring a state of emergency. This measure allows for the swift allocation of resources and coordination of response efforts. Ophelia, currently positioned 120 miles southeast of Wilmington, is moving at a steady 13 mph in a north-northwest direction. It is expected to make landfall on the North Carolina coast before traversing through eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula over the weekend.

Residents are urged to stay informed through official channels, follow any evacuation orders issued, and prepare emergency kits. Safety remains paramount as the community bands together to weather the impending storm. With collective vigilance and preparedness, Wilmington aims to navigate Ophelia's impact and emerge resilient.

                          <media:description>As Hurricane Idalia relentlessly advances towards Florida, USA, the state is already grappling with the harbingers of its impending fury. A video captured by @AJS9619 on August 30, 2023, reveals the ominous scene of flash flooding inundating roads and fierce winds gusting through Palm Avenue and Banana Court in downtown Sarasota. Despite the hurricane's full impact yet to be realized at the time, the footage paints a dire picture of the havoc it could unleash. Authorities have issued grave warnings about the storm surge, with the potential to elevate ocean waters up to a staggering 16 feet above ground level—a perilous situation that has already led to surges of up to six feet in some Florida towns. The urgency of the situation has prompted the evacuation of over 1.5 million residents across 28 counties, highlighting the catastrophic potential of this surging menace.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On August 27, 2023, Majorca, Spain, experienced a dramatic shift from its usual sunny paradise as hurricane-force winds exceeding 75mph and unrelenting torrential rain descended upon the island. Tourists were caught off guard by the extreme weather, captured in footage that showcased sun loungers soaring through the air and roofing materials being flung onto neighboring buildings. The tranquil scenes of beaches and swimming pools gave way to chaos, as holidaymakers sought shelter amidst the tumult. Even a P&amp;O cruise ship was not spared, breaking free from moorings and colliding with a freight vessel in the midst of the tempest. Fierce winds, rain, and hail transformed the once-idyllic hotel resorts into unrecognizable landscapes, and reports indicate that the island endured over 80 flood-related incidents within a single hour. </media:description>

                          <media:title>Devastating deluge: Southern California faces rare tropical storm flooding from Hurricane Hillary</media:title>
                          <media:description>On August 21, 2023, @kangspace589 captured a gripping video that depicted the aftermath of Hurricane Hilary in downtown Coachella, California. In the video, the roads could be seen covered in flood waters. This marked the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, resulting in widespread flooding of roads, the toppling of trees, and a dramatic rescue operation involving a bulldozer to save older residents trapped in a care home by mud. While the storm had significantly weakened as it moved over the Rocky Mountains, the National Hurricane Center in Miami issued warnings about the possibility of "continued life-threatening and locally catastrophic flooding" across the southwestern U.S. due to the aftermath of record-breaking rainfall. Forecasters indicated that the risk of flooding extended to states further north, particularly across southeastern Oregon into the west-central mountains of Idaho, with potential additional challenges posed by thunderstorms and localized torrential rains in the days ahead.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On August 19, 2023, Storm Betty's ferocious onslaught struck Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland, as captured in a video by @snowbiewx. Powerful waves, driven by intense winds from the storm, relentlessly battered the barrier during the night. The impact of the storm was further amplified by heavy rains and strong winds, prompting the Met Office to issue warnings about potential floods and the risk of fatalities due to massive waves crashing onto sea fronts. As dawn broke, the aftermath revealed a landscape of havoc: roads obstructed by fallen trees and debris, flooding necessitating a major clean-up effort, and over 70,000 homes, farms, and businesses grappling with power outages caused by the storm's force. In Clontarf, the public baths area bore the brunt of the high tide's assault, leaving behind swathes of seaweed and wreckage where paradise once stood, prompting local residents to join in the cleanup efforts.</media:description>

                          <media:description>A powerful and destructive tornado swept through Minsk, Belarus on July 22, 2023, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake after a day of heavy rain, thunderstorms, and squally winds. The Zaslavsky reservoir was engulfed by a hurricane, and the fury of the storm was captured on video as tornadoes formed over Zhdanovichi and moved towards the Minsk Sea. In the midst of this chaos, two families of Minsk residents who had sought shelter in a gazebo found themselves in a perilous situation as the structure threatened to collapse under the force of the wind. Thankfully, quick-thinking fellow vacationers came to their rescue, preventing a potential disaster. However, in another part of the area, tragedy struck as trees fell on a group of young people enjoying a day out in the open. One young girl lost her life, while two others sustained injuries. Emergency workers from the Ministry of Emergencies swiftly responded, and their efforts continue as they assess the damage and clear fallen trees near the village of Zarechye-1. The city and its residents now begin the process of recovery and healing after this harrowing natural calamity.</media:description>

                          <media:description>As of July 15, 2023, Akita Prefecture, Japan, is facing ongoing disruptions due to severe flooding caused by heavy downpours. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has issued orange-level heavy rain and landslide warnings, along with yellow flood advisories across the region. The storms, accompanied by strong winds, lightning, hail, and potential tornadoes, have led to dangerous river levels and widespread transportation disruptions. Several cities and towns, including Akita, Daisen, Noshiro, Oga, Fujisato, Gojome, and Hachirogata, are under evacuation orders. The Babame and Uchikawa rivers have overflowed, causing significant flooding and damage to properties in affected areas. Tragically, one person has already lost their life due to the heavy rain. The Akita Shinkansen has been suspended between Morioka and Akita stations, further exacerbating the situation. @be5b48tgmailcom captured a video showing flooding in Akita station east exit rotary.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Typhoon Mawar strikes Guam: devastation unleashed near hotel</media:title>
                          <media:description>Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory, woke up to scenes of destruction on 24th May, 2023 as Typhoon Mawar wreaked havoc on the island. The howling winds and torrential rainfall that accompanied the typhoon left residents without power and caused significant damage across the region. As officials began to assess the aftermath, it became clear that the storm had uprooted trees, damaged cars, and blocked roads, leading to a state of emergency on the island.

Residents of Guam, still reeling from the impact of Typhoon Mawar, found themselves in a dire situation as essential services were disrupted. The widespread power outage meant that businesses were unable to operate normally, leaving many without access to vital supplies. Long queues formed outside the few shops that managed to stay open, where residents clamored to purchase food and other necessities. With limited access to internet and malfunctioning ATMs, cash became the only accepted form of payment in many establishments.

One particularly stark visual of the destruction was captured in a video footage taken by @T9Cryptonite. The clip showed uprooted trees scattered near a hotel, their roots ripping through the ground. The cars parked nearby were not spared either, as they bore the marks of the fallen trees, crushed and damaged. To add to the chaos, a road was completely blocked by an uprooted tree, further hampering recovery efforts and hindering residents' ability to move around the island.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Calgary under siege: poor air quality and spreading wildfires plague the city</media:title>
                          <media:description>The city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada found itself in the grip of a dire situation as a special weather alert was issued on Tuesday, warning residents about poor air quality and reduced visibility. The alarming conditions were a result of tinder-dry weather and shifting winds, which elevated the risk of spreading wildfires in the oil-producing province of Alberta.

According to the provincial government, a staggering 90 wildfires were currently active in Alberta, with 23 of them completely out of control. This dire situation has forced approximately 20,000 people to evacuate their homes, seeking safety elsewhere. The impact of the fires reached even further, affecting the oil and gas industry, causing several producers to shut down operations. At one point, a significant 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, accounting for 3.7% of national production, were forced to cease.

@DeniseHenwood, a resident of Calgary, captured the devastating conditions on video on 16th May, 2023 and shared her experience. In her footage, she revealed the surrounding atmosphere filled with smoke, highlighting the poor air quality. "Woke up smelling smoke INSIDE the house. You can barely step outside. Burns eyes, throat, ugh, getting worse by the minute," she lamented.

                          <media:title>Flooding on Bond Street overbridge in Kingsland, New Zealand</media:title>
                          <media:description>On May 8th, 2023, Kingsland, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, experienced an unusual flooding event that caused some disruption to the traffic flow but created a rare spectacle for onlookers. The northwest motorway overbridge at Bond Street was submerged in water, creating a surreal sight for drivers who passed through it.

According to eyewitness accounts, the flooding was caused by heavy rainfall that had been pouring down in the area for several hours. The water level on the overbridge rose quickly, creating a layer of water that was about 20 meters above the motorway. While the flooding caused some inconvenience to the traffic, there were no reports of accidents or major disruptions.

@AndiBeeeee, a local resident who captured the flooding on video, shared her experience on social media. She described the sight as rare and fascinating, saying, "Not often you get flooding 20m above a motorway." Her video showed cars moving slowly on the flooded overbridge, with water splashing up against their wheels.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Two EF0 tornadoes hit Carson and Compton, causing minor damage to buildings and vehicles</media:title>
                          <media:description>On Thursday morning the 4th of May, 2023, two tornadoes touched down in the Carson and Compton area of Southern California, USA causing minor damage to buildings and vehicles.

The first tornado, rated as an EF0 with winds swirling up to 75 mph, hit around 8:45 a.m. near Avalon Boulevard and E. Walnut Street. It caused concentrated short paths of minor damage to a couple of buildings, vehicle damage from debris, and tree damage. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries.

About 10 minutes later, another EF0 tornado hit nearby in Compton near Greenleaf Boulevard and S. Santa Fe Avenue. The second tornado had winds estimated up to 65 mph and it lasted about four minutes. It produced a very narrow path of minor damage, including a downed power line, tarps torn from a nursery, minor roof damage to a home, downed small tree limbs, and siding damage to a couple of homes.

Initially, the National Weather Service identified only a single tornado in the area, but they later issued an update indicating two separate events. The tornadoes were relatively weak, but they were still capable of causing significant damage to property and vehicles.

Residents in the affected areas reported seeing the tornadoes and shared footage of the event on social media. One individual, @Aldough__, even captured a video of a mini tornado in Compton and shared it on Twitter with the comment, "I just saw a mini Tornado in Compton.... life is great."</media:description>

                          <media:title>North Palm Beach hit by destructive tornado for second consecutive day causing widespread damage and power outages</media:title>
                          <media:description>Florida was hit by severe weather for the second consecutive day on Sunday, 30th of April, 2023 as a destructive tornado spun through residential areas of North Palm Beach. The tornado caused widespread damage, flipping cars, snapping trees, and knocking out power for thousands of residents.

On Saturday evening, a tornado swept through the city of Palm Beach Gardens, causing significant damage. The Palm Beach Gardens city government reported that there was “roof, structural, and vehicle damage throughout the city,” and residents reported that the wind was strong enough to blow the roof off one apartment building and blast away at least one apartment door. Thankfully, no injuries were reported.

The storm also caused chaos in the nearby neighborhood of Sanctuary Cove in North Palm Beach, where branches flew dangerously in the wind, trees collapsed on vehicles, and windows of homes and cars were shattered. A large construction vehicle was also damaged, and a park bench was blown away.

Residents in the affected areas praised the quick response of first responders, who arrived on the scene promptly to help those in need. However, the experience was far from pleasant for those who were caught up in the storm.

One resident, @CannaMindSee420, who witnessed the tornado, said: "Not the most pleasant experience! Location Pleasant Dr. &amp; US1 Facing East!" Their statement serves as a testament to the severity of the weather event and the impact it had on the local community.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Rockslide rescue: snow plow clears Highway 74 during heavy snowfall in Evergreen, Colorado</media:title>
                          <media:description>Heavy snowfall can be a beautiful sight to behold, but it can also cause treacherous conditions on the roads. Such was the case on the evening of April 25th, 2023 in Evergreen, Colorado, USA where a snowstorm had begun to accumulate roughly 2.0 inches of snow.

 @jcosrangerjason, a resident of the area, captured a live shot of the snowfall and shared it on social media. The video showed heavy snow falling and a snow plow packed in the background. But the most eventful part of the evening was not caught on camera.

The author reported that he had to use his snow plow to move a rock slide from the roadway on Highway 74. The rock slide could have caused serious damage to any passing vehicles, and it was fortunate that he was able to use his snow plow to clear the way.

Rock slides are a common occurrence in the mountains of Colorado, and they can be caused by a variety of factors, such as heavy rain or snow, earthquakes, or even human activity. They can also be incredibly dangerous, and it takes skilled professionals to remove them safely.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On April 12, 2023, Fort Lauderdale Airport was closed to all flights and roadway traffic due to severe flooding caused by heavy rainfall. A video shared on social media by @denise_sakowski shows the entrance and exit roads of the airport congested with vehicular traffic, causing chaos and long delays for travelers.

According to @denise_sakowski, the heavy traffic and flooding had been ongoing for over five hours by the time the video was taken, and there seemed to be no end in sight. The airport authorities advised travelers not to attempt to enter or leave the airport until the weather improved, as the roads remained flooded and congested.

                          <media:description>On March 15, 2023, a video was recorded in the Indonesian province of Central Java, showing Mount Merapi, one of the world's most active volcanoes. The footage was captured by a man named @pradit.cahyadi, who intentionally positioned himself near the monitoring post of the mountain to capture the stunning scene.

Mount Merapi, located on the border of the provinces of Central Java and Yogyakarta, has a long history of eruptions, with the most recent occurring in 2018. The volcano is constantly monitored by a team of experts and instruments to provide early warnings to the surrounding population.

The video taken by @pradit.cahyadi shows a close-up view of the crater of the mountain, with lava and ash spewing out of it. The footage captures the raw power and beauty of nature as the volcano continues to erupt. While it is an incredible sight to see, it is important to remember the potential danger that a volcano presents.

                          <media:description>On March 13th, 2023, in the village of Verkhnee Sancheleevo, Samara, Russia, a girl left her house to work and walked straight through deep water. In a video posted by @thorzhevskaya_tlt, the girl can be seen braving the floodwaters that had surrounded her home from three sides.

The flood was caused by a nearby lake that had overflowed its banks due to heavy rainfall. The Ministry of Emergency Situations was on site for three days to help with the situation. Despite their efforts, water entered the girl’s house in the kitchen and completely flooded the bathhouse and guest house.

Thankfully, the water has now receded and everything is dry. The girl and her family were able to weather the flood and come out on the other side.</media:description>

                          <media:description>Piura City, Piura Province, Peru - On April 2nd, 2023, Piura Province was hit by a severe flood caused by intense rainfall. The rains were triggered by the summer storm in Máncora, a popular tourist destination in the area. The heavy downpour lasted for about an hour and a half, causing three ravines to be activated after almost 25 years. The current devastated everything in its path, blocking roads, and leaving hundreds of travelers stranded.

The Cabo Blanco ravine, also known as 'La Pepa', was one of the three ravines that were activated, causing severe damage. The torrential rain caused flooding in the area, and trucks were taken away by the current. The La Cruz district highway was completely blocked, forcing hundreds of travelers to walk to reach their destination.

The flooding caused by the activation of the ravines has affected several districts in Piura Province. Families and tourists who were enjoying the beaches and the summer in Máncora were surprised by the fall of huaicos that caused flooding after the streams nearby were activated. The situation was dire, with the water current blocking roads and leaving people stranded.</media:description>

                          <media:title>Riding in a tractor bucket: the scary yet ingenious way to cross a flooded river in Penza, Russia</media:title>
                          <media:description>Spring flooding can often cause unexpected problems for communities, and the residents of one village in the Penza region of Russia recently found themselves facing an unusual challenge. Due to the high waters caused by the local river's spill, a hundred meters of the road became submerged and turned into a turbulent stream. This made it difficult for locals to get across, but they came up with an ingenious solution - crossing the stream in the bucket of a wheeled tractor.

Eyewitnesses admit that the method of crossing the stream looks rather scary, but people simply have no other option to get home. Several people get into the bucket, it rises, and the tractor starts moving across the stream. The tractor driver must navigate the swirling waters and ensure that everyone reaches the other side safely.

Although it might seem dangerous, judging by the frames of the published video, the tractor driver coped with the difficult task quite well. The "passengers" were delivered safe and sound to the other "shore". This shows the resilience and resourcefulness of people in the face of unexpected challenges.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On the night of Sunday, February 26th, 2023, residents of Ardrossan and Saltcoats in Scotland were treated to a stunning display of the Northern Lights. The aurora activity was particularly intense, lasting for a full two hours and providing a breathtaking show for those lucky enough to witness it.

One person who did get to see the show was @DynamicScotland, who captured the beauty of the Northern Lights in a stunning timelapse video. The video shows the vivid colors of the aurora dancing across the sky, illuminating the darkness with an otherworldly glow. It's clear that @DynamicScotland had a front-row seat to one of nature's most incredible spectacles.

In fact, @DynamicScotland notes that this was the most vivid display of the Northern Lights they had seen in years, visible even to the naked eye. It's no wonder that they describe it as an "absolutely incredible show".</media:description>

                          <media:title>Northern Lights Time Lapses on British Airways Flight from Billund to London</media:title>
                          <media:description>On a recent flight from Billund, Denmark to London, passengers were treated to a stunning display of the Northern Lights. The breathtaking view was captured by passenger Ben Applin, who managed to get some incredible time lapses despite the challenges of filming on a plane.

The display of the Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, is a rare and beautiful phenomenon that can only be seen in certain parts of the world. Passengers on the British Airways flight were lucky enough to witness this natural wonder from the comfort of their seats.

In a tweet, Ben Applin thanked the pilot for dimming the cabin lights to allow passengers to enjoy the stunning view. The time lapses he captured are a testament to his skill as a photographer, and serve as a reminder of the awe-inspiring power of nature.

The Northern Lights are caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with the Earth's magnetic field. This creates a stunning display of colorful lights in the sky, which is visible in certain parts of the world during certain times of the year.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On the night of February 27th, 2023, a series of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes barreled through Kansas and Oklahoma. One of these tornadoes, confirmed as an EF2, struck Norman, Oklahoma's third-largest city. Fortunately, despite the damage and destruction caused by the tornado, there were no reported fatalities.

A timelapse video captured the storm rolling in moments before the tornado struck. The video was taken at the intersection of Hwy 9 and Jenkins Avenue in Norman. The footage shows the ominous clouds and darkening skies that preceded the violent storm.

The tornado caused significant damage in Norman, including power outages, downed trees and power lines, and damage to homes and businesses. At least 12 people were injured in the storm, but none of the injuries were critical. Emergency responders and volunteers quickly worked to clear debris and restore power to affected areas.</media:description>

                          <media:title>An avalanche hit the mountain resorts, knocking out three skiers in Russia</media:title>
                          <media:description>On February 20, 2023, between the Alpika resorts of the GTZ Gazprom and Rosa Khutor, there was an avalanche in the mountains of Sochi, Russia. The incident was caught on camera by eyewitnesses and posted online. Local residents reported that the avalanche also demolished a power line pylon.

Thankfully, there were no casualties reported as a result of the avalanche. However, a snow cannon was destroyed, and the protective mesh was damaged. The fence and communications on the bobsleigh track along the mudflow allotment were also broken.

In the second video, another incident happened: a group of skiers had a close call with an unexpected avalanche at the Laura ski resort, also in Sochi, Russia. The incident occurred as the skiers were taking a break under the roof of a local bar, following a successful run down the mountain.

A layer of snow that had been building up on the roof suddenly rolled off and covered the three people inside. The skiers were caught off guard and did not have time to react before being buried under the snow. Thankfully, eyewitnesses and employees of the ski resort were quick to react and rushed to the scene with shovels to dig out the buried skiers.

Fortunately, the skiers buried in the avalanche were not injured and were quickly handed over to doctors for a general examination. All people who go to mountainous areas should take this as a warning to be ready for anything and to stay alert at all times.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictability of nature and the dangers that can arise in mountainous regions. While it had been snowing for three days in the Sochi mountains, a sudden change in weather conditions led to a sharp warming, causing avalanches to descend at an altitude of more than 500 meters above sea level.</media:description>

                          <media:description>Winter weather can be beautiful, but it can also make getting around a challenge. That was the case for @e.boudreau and her fiance on December 23, 2022, when a snowstorm hit Portland, Oregon. They had plans to go out to brunch that morning, but the slippery roads made it clear that it was not safe to venture out.

She was adamant about staying inside, but her fiance was more optimistic. He thought that the roads would be fine and wanted to check for himself. She filmed him going outside and trying to go down, but the pathway is slippery. When he was trying to back up the hill, it was so funny that he was trying his best to walk on an icy road. As it turned out, she was right. The roads were treacherous, and her fiance quickly realized that they wouldn't be able to leave the house.</media:description>

                          <media:description>On February 17, 2023, a powerful storm named Otto wreaked havoc on the North Sea, causing rough conditions for ships sailing in the area. The storm hit Norway and Europe, causing distress and concern for those out at sea.

One individual, John Buchan, captured footage of the storm from his fishing vessel, located 60 miles off the west coast of Norway. The video shows the immense power of the storm as it caused waves to crash violently against the ship.

The North Sea is no stranger to severe weather, but the impact of Storm Otto was particularly significant. The storm's high winds and heavy rain caused dangerous conditions for those at sea and onshore.</media:description>

                          <media:title>A man is saved from drowning in floods in Indonesia</media:title>
                          <media:description>On January 29, 2023, Manado, Indonesia, was hit by severe flooding that affected 40 locations in 25 urban villages. The Manado Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) reported that nine of these villages were also impacted by landslides and fallen trees, adding to the already disastrous situation.

Amid the chaos and destruction caused by the floods, a heart-stopping moment was captured on video by @cewebumi00. The video shows a man struggling to stay afloat in the floodwaters. Fortunately, the man was saved in the nick of time as rescuers reached him with a piece of wood, pulling him to safety. The video shows the relief and gratitude of the man as he is rescued, and according to sources, he is now doing fine.

The BPBD has been working tirelessly to evacuate residents from the affected areas and provide them with food, shelter, and other basic necessities. The Indonesian government has also activated its disaster response plan and deployed troops to assist with rescue and relief efforts.

It is not yet clear what caused the flooding, but heavy rainfall in the region in recent days is believed to have contributed to the disaster. The Indonesian meteorological agency has issued a warning to residents to remain vigilant as further heavy rainfall is expected in the coming days.

The people of Manado are in dire need of help, and the government and aid organizations are working together to provide the support they need. This rescue serves as a reminder of the bravery and determination of those working to save lives in the face of such disasters.</media:description>

                          <media:description>After a heavy snowfall, the children went out to swing on a swing in the courtyard of the house. As can be seen in the footage, the children dug up the structure on their own.

On the eve of the snowfall in the region interrupted road communication with several villages. Snow cover in some places exceeds 60 cm. At least about five settlements were left without electricity. Schools have been canceled in several districts of Primorye, and drivers have been advised not to drive on the roads unnecessarily.</media:description>

                          <media:description>Flights are currently unable to take off or land at Gatwick Airport due to heavy snow in the area. Snowfall has swept across most of Sussex this afternoon (December 11) causing widespread disruption to travel.

The author said: "Apparently, according to our captain, the first attempt at clearing the runway at #Gatwick “didn’t work” so they are doing it again."

                          <media:description>4 October 2022, Belgorod, Russia

This is a common atmospheric phenomenon - but it has led to rumors about the use of "the latest weapons."

Due to the fact that Belgorod is located near the border with Ukraine, speculation began to appear on social networks that this could be somehow connected with the war. In recent months, glows and flashes have been repeatedly observed over the city - basically, they were associated with the work of air defense.

The Phobos Weather Center explained that what had happened was just an ordinary atmospheric phenomenon called a halo - a secondary glow around a light source. A sun pillar is one of the most common types of halo. It is formed due to the refraction of light in ice crystals suspended in the air, and can be observed in winter damp calm weather when the Sun is at a certain angle to the horizon, or when there is a bright source of light on the earth.</media:description>
